Freya is an application built using Flutter
To assist users in finding information related to violence against women, be it physically, mentally or sexually.
We provide an Opinion Education feature. Capable of providing violence prevention and helping provide support to victims.

In line with SDGs Number 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions) and 5 (Gender Equality). We hope to provide a solution that can reduce or perhaps end physical, sexual, and psychological violence against women.

 ## How do we tackle this problem?

These are the options we provide:

* Counseling and Complaints Report
* Share Confide To Other
* Opinion Education
